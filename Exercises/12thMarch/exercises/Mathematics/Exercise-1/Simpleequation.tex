	Tasks to be performed:
	\begin{enumerate}
		\item Execute \[ ds^2 = dx_1^2 + dx_2^2 + dx_3^2 - c^2 dt^2 \]
		\item Write the equation for square of a+b.
	\end{enumerate}
	\section*{Demonstration}
Testing notation for limits
 

 
	
	
The well known Pythagorean theorem \(x^2 + y^2 = z^2\) was 
proved to be invalid for other exponents. 
Meaning the next equation has no integer solutions:

\[ x^n + y^n = z^n \]
